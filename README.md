# 👀 Problem

There is a lack of a comprehensive and user-friendly platform dedicated to the promotion, sale, and exploration of Moroccan culinary delights through a dedicated Android app. The absence of such a platform hinders the effective showcasing and accessibility of diverse Moroccan food items, potentially limiting the exposure and market reach for local culinary businesses and depriving users of a convenient and centralized means to discover, purchase, and savor the rich gastronomic offerings of Morocco.
