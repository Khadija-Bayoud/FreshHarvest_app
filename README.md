# 👀 Problem

Moroccan farmers encounter challenges in making informed decisions due to limited access to crucial agricultural data. Traditional methods of obtaining farming information are inefficient and time-consuming, leading to suboptimal resource utilization, reduced productivity, and lower income. This is particularly evident when farmers explore or initiate farming in new regions, where they lack immediate access to vital data such as weather conditions and soil types, etc. The absence of this essential information makes it difficult for farmers to adapt their cultivation strategies, resulting in potential inefficiencies and decreased yields.
<br> <br>



# 💭 Proposal
Smart فلاح proposes the development of an LLM-powered chatbot, a user-friendly platform tailored to the specific needs of Moroccan farmers. This chatbot not only answers farmers' questions but also provides valuable insights about agricultural practices. By leveraging region-specific data, weather conditions, and soil types, the chatbot aims to be a comprehensive tool that empowers farmers with timely and relevant information.
